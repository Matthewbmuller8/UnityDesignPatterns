/* Singletons have been covered in great detail by many sources
 * and all say to use it sparingly.
 * 
 * I think having a central singleton with references to other managers 
 * is a better way of handing things, instead of making every manager a singleton.
 * 
 * This leaves less room for error. Check Service Locator pattern if need be.
